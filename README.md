# Notes

Here lie my notes.

## Style

The LaTeX style and template are shamelessly taken from [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/), with some changes to suit my personal taste.

## Disclaimer

These notes were originally meant for my own understanding and organization of thoughts, and as such, they may be unpolished, incomplete, or even occasionally incorrect.

I share them in the hope that they may serve as a useful reference, but they should not
be treated as a primary source of learning. Readers are strongly encouraged to consult
original texts and authoritative resources for a more rigorous and accurate treatment of
the topics discussed.

Use these notes as a companion to your studies, not as a substitute for the depth and
clarity provided by well-established literature.

Feedbacks are welcome.
