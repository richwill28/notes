# Notes on Complexity Theory

This is a personal exposition project of mine. Its primary purpose is to serve as an accessible reference to some of the most fundamental results in complexity theory.

## Motivation

I often find myself scouring through multiple references just to find a satisfying explanation of a certain theorem or proof, and too frequently, the available exposition fall shortâ€”either lacking in rigor (e.g. by establishing only part of the theorem), or missing the necessary intuition that makes it all "click". In my notes, I aim to strike a good balance between intuition and rigor.

I think it's nice to have a reliable reference that pulls everything together in one place, and I hope you find these notes as useful as I do. In general, I'd rather explain things in too much detail than not enough. So I apologize in advance if some parts come across as lengthy and redundant. Feedbacks are welcome.

This is a work in progress.
