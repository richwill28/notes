# Notes on Complexity Theory

![Badge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richwill28/notes/refs/heads/assets/assets/warning-np-hardness-and-existential-dread.svg)

This is a personal exposition project of mine. The primary purpose is to create a clear and accessible reference to some of the most fundamental results in complexity theory.

## Motivation

I often find myself scouring through multiple references to find a satisfying explanation for a theorem or proof, only to be met with expositions that lack rigor or miss the necessary intuition to make it all click. In these notes, I aim to strike a balance between providing solid intuition and maintaining reasonable rigor. Keep in mind that I prefer to err on the side of over-explaining rather than under-explaining, so I apologize in advance if some parts feel lengthy or repetitive.

I hope you find these notes as useful as I do. All the best.
