\chapter*{Preface}
These notes are a loose amalgamation of ideas, concepts, and
explanations drawn from various books, papers, and personal
reflections. They were originally meant for my own understanding and
organization of thoughts, and as such, they may be unpolished,
incomplete, or even occasionally incorrect.

I share them in the hope that they may serve as a useful reference,
but they should not be treated as a primary source of learning.
Readers are strongly encouraged to consult original texts and
authoritative resources for a more rigorous and accurate treatment of
the topics discussed.

Use these notes as a companion to your studies, not as a substitute
for the depth and clarity provided by well-established literature.
