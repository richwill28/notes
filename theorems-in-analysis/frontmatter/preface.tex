\chapter*{Preface}
These notes are a loose amalgamation of ideas, concepts, and
explanations drawn from various sources, particularly the following books:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Real Analysis: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook by Jay
    Cummings \cite{cummings2019real}
  \item Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott \cite{abbott2015understanding}
  \item Introduction to Real Analysis by Bartle \& Sherbert
    \cite{bartle2011introduction}
  \item Mathematical Analysis by Tom M. Apostol \cite{apostol1974mathematical}
  \item Counterexamples in Analysis by Gelbaum \& Olmsted
    \cite{gelbaum2003counterexamples}
\end{enumerate}
They were originally meant for my own understanding and organization
of thoughts, and as such, they may be unpolished, incomplete, or even
occasionally incorrect.

I share them in the hope that they may serve as a useful reference,
but they should not be treated as a primary source of learning.
Readers are strongly encouraged to consult original texts and
authoritative resources for a more rigorous and accurate treatment of
the topics discussed.

Use these notes as a companion to your studies, not as a substitute
for the depth and clarity provided by well-established literature.
