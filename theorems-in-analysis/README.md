# A Laundry List of Theorems in Analysis

![Badge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richwill28/notes/refs/heads/assets/assets/made-with-too-many-epsilons-and-not-enough-coffee.svg)

I started these notes as a quick reference for theorems and definitions in analysis, hence the title. Over time, however, they've evolved into something more. While I still recommend treating them as supplementary references rather than primary sources, the theory is developed with care. The exposition is kept minimal, as it's not meant to be a textbook, but I do include occasional remarks where I think they'll help with understanding. Also, I hope the proofs presented are clear and accessible.

## Disclaimer

Some of the exposition, particularly the proofs, are shamelessly taken from textbooks, and I do not claim them as my own. I only make changes when necessaryâ€”after all, when the proof is already well written, why fix it?

This is a work in progress. Feedbacks are welcome.
